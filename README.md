The Debouncer class resolves the problem of overloading a resource with multiple requests that may be slow to complete. It debounces requests with the same name, ensuring that only one instance of the request is executed at any given time, and returns the result of the request as soon as it is completed. This helps to optimize resource usage, reduce latency, and prevent the resource from becoming overloaded.


This code demonstrates how the Debouncer class can be used to efficiently manage and execute long-running tasks in a parallel and thread-safe manner. By debouncing requests with the same name, the code ensures that the long-running task is executed only once, and that the results are returned as soon as possible without overloading the resource.


Execute the code and verify that all threads receive identical results, and that the total execution time is 10 seconds (which is the duration of the Delay method).
